# Surface Crack Detection using CNN

## Overview

This project detects industrial surface cracks using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).  
The model is trained on crack and non-crack surface images to automatically classify damaged surfaces.

The project performs:
- Image preprocessing
- Data augmentation
- CNN model training
- Model evaluation
- Surface crack prediction
